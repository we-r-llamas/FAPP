<h1>Furious Additive Puzzle Piecing</h1>

<li> The act of developing under the <b>FAPP</b> principles is known as <b>FAPPing</b>, and any developer who does so is commonly referred to as a <b>FAPPer</b> </li>

<li> If your team develops using the <b>FAPP</b> process, it is common practice to sit in an enclosed circle known as a <b>CircleFAPP</b> </li>

<li> Every 30 minutes a different developer sits in the middle of the CircleFAPP and is enclosed by the other FAPPers. The person in the middle of the CircleFAPP is known as the <b>FAPPCatcher</b>, and their job is to manually manage and merge all commits made by the other FAPPers. </li>

<li> If there are no commits for the FAPPCatcher to manage, they must spend their time in the CircleFAPP making cosmetic changes <b>ONLY</b>. </li>

<li> This 30 minutes is known as the <b>FAPPCycle</b>. Half-way through each FAPPCycle a bell will sound, and for the following 2 minutes each FAPPer will lean over and take control of the machine to their right. During these two minutes, each FAPPer must make at least one cosmetic change (note that <b>ONLY</b> cosmetic changes are allowed during this 2 minute window). </li>

<li> How many cosmetic changes your team manages to do in this 2 minute window is the key to determining your teams level of Furiousness </li>
